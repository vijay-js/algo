>>> Always Make this mental model
    element a[1][4] implies -> Go to the 2nd row which is a[1] and pick the 5th element in second row . which is a[1][4]
    a[i] => Always gives the entire row

>> Running a loop to fetch elements in rows first would be better as its stored in Row Major Order in the memory. So because of cache friendliness -
will fetch beside elements.




TRANSPOSE OF A MATRIX
a[i][j] = a[j][i]

-- For a square matrix - It is just switching rows with columns and columns with rows.

>>> Important to note that Transpose of a matrix can be done in place with just swapping opposite elements in diagonals.
-> This can be done by running a loop while traversing row wise -> running a column loop from i+1 to end and swap elements




ROTATION OF MATRIX (USE TRANSPOSE)

>> Rotation of a matrix can be done using a
    >> Transpose of a matrix and then
    >> reversing either row or column



DIAGONAL MATRIX PRINT ::
>> See the start elements of each diagonal -> first row and last column (and print the elements based on the increment)


SPIRAL ORDER OF MATRIX ::

>> Keep 4 points for tracing the boundaries => Print Top Row, Last Column, Bottom Row, First Column and keep reducing the boundaries after printing;



SEARCH IN SORTED MATRIX ::

2 variations ::
   > Only row wise sorted and column wise sorted --> Step wise -> Start from last column of first row and either decrement column or increament row
   > FULLY SORTED
        > Treat as array and binary search. row => mid / n ; col = mid%n
