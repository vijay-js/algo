In Undirected Graph ::

Key insight is that except parent while traversing if there is any edge to visited vertex -> there is a cycle

While BFS or DFS -> If other than the parent node any other visited node is part of your adjacency list - Cycyle exists print that


In Directed Graph

While DFS -> Entire path is in the stack - so if node is already visited => enough because even if parent comes - > then its a cycle

With BFS =>

Use Khans's BFS via indegrees for topological sorting  -> Count the number of time vertex is popped from queue. If count
